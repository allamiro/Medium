## Introduction
Why Ge’ez Bible Text Detection Matters
Ge’ez is a Semitic language which has a very rich background and is still used in two African countries: Ethiopia and Eritrea. Despite the fact that Ge’ez has been spoken by the Ethiopian and Eritrean peoples for centuries as their main language, it is used today exclusively in religious practices of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Beta Israel people.
The script that developed from Ge’ez similarly serves as the foundation for numerous current languages, such as Amharic and Tigrinya.
Recognition of handwritten Ge’ez text is technologically difficult because of the old writing and poor condition of several manuscripts. But as seen with the OCR technology advancements and with the help of annotation tools such as Labelme, these challenges are quite possible to solve. Hence, we can enhance the digitization of Ge’ez text and achieve greater accuracy by providing better datasets and more enhanced and efficient text detection models. This makes it easier to further research and analyze the findings to uncover details that might add to the advancements of knowledge on ancient civilizations.
