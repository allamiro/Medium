## Genetic Algorithm for Lennard-Jones Clusters in Cybersecurity & Machine Learning

This repository explores the application of Genetic Algorithms (GA) to two distinct but conceptually linked domains:

* Molecular Optimization: Using GA to minimize Lennard-Jones potential for atomic clusters, a classical benchmark in computational physics and optimization.
* Cybersecurity and ML: Applying GA for feature selection and classification in phishing URL detection, enhancing model performance and interpretability.
